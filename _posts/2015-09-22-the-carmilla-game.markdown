Set in the gap between seasons 1 and 2 of the Carmilla webseries, The Carmilla Game is an unofficial visual novel that lets players experience the adventures of the main characters in the Styrian wilderness. From bears to riddles to just a little bit of heartbreak, players get to make decisions and watch as the consequences unfold. The game is currently in development, and will be free to play on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.
