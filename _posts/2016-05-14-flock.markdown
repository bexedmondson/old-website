Over the past year, I've been building a game as part of my final year project. It's a single-player game based around finding goals in a landscape, using swarm intelligence and simulation. The player pilots a small flock of paper aeroplanes (which are controlled using the [boids algorithm](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)) towards small goals on the top of hills, with the aim of capturing as many as possoble before the time runs out. 
Like any good game, there's a challenge: distributed across the landscape is a team of insects being controlled by a particle swarm optimisation algorithm. These agents are also trying to capture the goals, and when the time runs out the winning team is the one with the most goals.
## Idea
As you might imagine, I've been interested in game development for a long time. I'd dabbled in a couple of engines, but mostly due to hardware constraints I'd never got as far as making a "proper" game, so when my final year project came around, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity. 
Also, I'd had an interest in swarm intelligence for a few months: [recent advances in robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1t4M2XnIhI) had brought the concept to my attention, and I knew that there was a third year module about it run by Dr Ed Keedwell. I approached him with a brief outline of my idea, he agreed to be my project supervisor, and my next year of coding was set out for me!
## Description
The final game has ended up being something I'm very proud of. It opens into the menu screen, which has the options to start the game, show the tutorial, list the credits or run unit tests.
The game level opens onto a hilly field with small yelow goals on top of the highest hills. There is also a small flock of paper aeroplanes flying in front of the camera, which the player can direct by clicking on the landscape to send the flock to that point.
The total number of goals that have been captured by either team (or that remain un-captured) is shown in the top-left corner. The player captures a goal by moving the flock near a goal, and the enemy team captures one by having two agents near a goal. If both teams have a claim on a goal, it switches back ro neutral, and each team has to wait the other out.
## Code Architecture
I planned the code to be set up fairly simply, and it ended up not deviating too much from the initial plan. For each object in the game environment, there is a class and a controller class. These are the boids (the paper aeroplanes in the flock), the agents (the members of the enemy team) and the goals. The controller class is responsible for initialising all the objects and sending information between them: for example, AgentController keeps track of the highest position of any agent in the swarm and gives that information to each agent every frame. Aside from these classes, there's also an InputController to handle mouse click information, and FinalGameMode
